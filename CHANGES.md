# v1.1.1, 2016-06-01

Minor changes, bug fixes.

Here are all the commits for this PR:
https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1

User facing:

- The matches can tell the players different match attributes than the ones
  actually being played (helpful for prob end tournaments where players cannot
  know the length of the match for example):
  https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/609
- A progress bar for the result set:
  https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/603

Internal:

- Reducing some test sizes: https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/601
- PEP8 improvements: https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/607
- Refactor of the match generator (noise is an attribute):
  https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/608

# v1.1.0, 2016-05-18

New strategies and minor changes to the test suite

Here are all the commits for this PR:
https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/compare/v1.0.1...v1.1.0

This introduces various new strategies to the library:

- Adaptive
- Handshake
- CyclerDC and CyclerDDC (used in the literature)
- 8 Finite State Machine strategies: Fortress3, Fortress4, Predator,
  Raider, Ripoff, SolutionB1, SolutionB5, Thumper

This version also includes a minor change to the test suite: shortening the size
of the tournaments being run in the integration tests.

Here is the PR that incorporated all of the above:
https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/591

# v1.0.1, 2016-05-15

Bug fix.

Here are all the commits for this PR:
https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1

During the previous refactor of the Tournament, the ability to create noisy
tournaments was lost. An integration test has been written to catch this in the
future: https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/596

# v1.0.0, 2016-05-14

Internal improvements, progress bar, minor interface change

Here are all the commits for this PR:
https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/compare/v0.0.31...v1.0.0

This release is the first major release stating the stability and maturity of
the library.

There are some user facing improvements:

- A progress bar: https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/578
- Whether or not a tournament is to be run using parallel processing is no
  longer a property of the tournament itself but an argument of the play method:
  https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/582

There were some extensive internal changes:

- The tournament attributes are passed to the players from the matches and not
  the tournament. This should make further things like changing what the players
  know about the tournament more straightforward:
  https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/537
- A huge re write of the actual way the tournament runs. This is the biggest
  such re write to date. The parallel workers now execute repetitions of matches
  which are written to disk as and when they complete. This greatly reduces the
  memory footprint of the tournament. A side effect of the above is a change of
  how the tournament is written to disk: the format is now much clearer (every
  row is a match): https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/572
