# v1.0.0, 2016-05-14

Internal improvements, progress bar, minor interface change

Here are all the commits for this PR:
https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/compare/v0.0.31...master

This release is the first major release stating the stability and maturity of
the library.

There are some user facing improvements:

- A progress bar: https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/578
- Whether or not a tournament is to be run using parallel processing is no
  longer a property of the tournament itself but an argument of the play method:
  https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/582

There were some extensive internal changes:

- The tournament attributes are passed to the players from the matches and not
  the tournament. This should make further things like changing what the players
  know about the tournament more straightforward:
  https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/537
- A huge re write of the actual way the tournament runs. This is the biggest
  such re write to date. The parallel workers now execute repetitions of matches
  which are written to disk as and when they complete. This greatly reduces the
  memory footprint of the tournament. A side effect of the above is a change of
  how the tournament is written to disk: the format is now much clearer (every
  row is a match): https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pull/572
