Axelrod
=======

A Python library with the following principles and goals:

1. Enabling the reproduction of previous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma research
   as easily as possible.
2. Creating the de-facto tool for future Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
   research.
3. Providing as simple a means as possible for anyone to define and contribute
   new and original Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma strategies.
4. Emphasizing readability along with an open and welcoming community that
   is accommodating for developers and researchers of a variety of skill levels.

Currently the library contains well over 150 strategies including classics such
as Tit-For-Tat (TFT) and Win-Stay-Lose-Shift (WSLS), recent variants including
zero-determinant strategies, and a variety of novel strategies including several
machine-learning based strategies. Many strategies are parameterized, allowing
for infinitely-many variations. We welcome new strategies and additions from the
literature: see `#379 <https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/issues/379>`_
for a list of known strategies and sources.

With these strategies the library and can perform head-to-head Matches, a
variety of tournament types (RoundRobin, Noisy, Spatially-distributed, and
probabilistically ending) and population dynamics including the Moran process
on graphs, while taking advantage of multi-core processors.

The library emphasizes reproducibility and validity. The current test suite
covers more than 99% of all code in the library, with many portions covered many
times over, including `randomly generated tests
<https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis-python>`_ that are created and
run regularly.

**Please contribute via pull request (or just get in touch with us).**

For an overview of how to use and contribute to this repository, see the
documentation: http://axelrod.readthedocs.org/

If you do use this library for your personal research we would love to hear
about it: please do add a link at the bottom of this README file (PR's welcome
or again, just let us know) :) If there is something that is missing in this
library and that you would like implemented so as to be able to carry out a
project please open an issue and let us know!

Installation
============

The simplest way to install is::

    $ pip install axelrod

Otherwise::

    $ git clone https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod.git
    $ cd Axelrod
    $ python setup.py install

Note that on Ubuntu `some
users <https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/issues/309>`_ have had problems
installing matplotlib. This seems to help with that::

    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
    sudo apt-get install libpng12-0-dev

Usage
-----

The full documentation can be found here:
`axelrod.readthedocs.org/ <http://axelrod.readthedocs.org/>`__.

The documentation includes details of how to setup a tournament but here is a
brief example showing how to get a simple tournament::

    >>> import axelrod as axl
    >>> axl.seed(0)  # Set a seed
    >>> players = [s() for s in axl.demo_strategies]  # Create players
    >>> tournament = axl.Tournament(players)  # Create a tournament
    >>> results = tournament.play()  # Play the tournament
    >>> results.ranked_names
    ['Defector', 'Grudger', 'Tit For Tat', 'Cooperator', 'Random: 0.5']


There is also a `notebooks repository
<https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod-notebooks>`_ which shows further
examples of using the library.

Results
=======

A tournament with the full set of strategies from the library can be found at
https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/tournament. These results can be easily viewed
at http://axelrod-tournament.readthedocs.org.
