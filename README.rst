Axelrod
=======

A repository with the following goals:

1. To enable the reproduction of previous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma research as easily as possible.
2. To produce the de-facto tool for any future Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma research.
3. To provide as simple a means as possible for anyone to define and contribute
   new and original Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma strategies.

**Please contribute strategies via pull request (or just get in touch
with us).**

For an overview of how to use and contribute to this repository, see the
documentation: http://axelrod.readthedocs.org/

If you do use this library for your personal research we would love to hear
about it: please do add a link at the bottom of this README file (PR's welcome
or again, just let us know) :) If there is something that is missing in this
library and that you would like implemented so as to be able to carry out a
project please open an issue and let us know!

Installation
============

The simplest way to install is::

    $ pip install axelrod

Here is an asciicast showing how to install and use the library:

.. image:: https://asciinema.org/a/18590.png
    :width: 50%
    :target: https://asciinema.org/a/18590

Otherwise::

    $ git clone https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod.git
    $ cd Axelrod
    $ python setup.py install

Note that (as documented at http://axelrod.readthedocs.org/) you do not need to
run the last step to use this package (you can run all the code from the root of
the directory).

Results
=======

This repository contains Python (2.7) code that reproduces the
tournament. To run the tournament, you simply need to:

::

    $ python run_axelrod

This automatically outputs a ``png`` file with the results. You can see
the results from the latest run of the tournament here:

.. figure:: ./assets/strategies_boxplot.png
   :alt:

You can see the results from the latest run of the tournament here with
the cheating strategies (which manipulate/read what the opponent does):

.. figure:: ./assets/all_strategies_boxplot.png
   :alt:

Also the pairwise performance of each strategy versus all others:

.. figure:: ./assets/strategies_payoff.png
   :alt:

Please do contribute :)

Note that you can run ``python run_axelrod -h`` for further
options available: for example, cheating strategies can be excluded for
faster results by running:

::

    $ python run_axelrod --xc --xa

You can also run the tournament in parallel (below will run 4 parallel
processes):

::

    $ python run_axelrod -p 4

You can run with all available CPUs with:

::

    $ python run_axelrod -p 0

Awesome visualisation
---------------------

`martinjc <https://github.com/martinjc>`__ put together a pretty awesome
visualisation of this using d3. Hosted on gh-pages it can be seen here:
`drvinceknight.github.io/Axelrod <http://drvinceknight.github.io/Axelrod/>`__.

Documentation
-------------

There is currently a very sparse set of documentation up here:
`axelrod.readthedocs.org/ <http://axelrod.readthedocs.org/>`__.

To write/render the documenation locally, you will need
`sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__:

::

    $ pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild mock

Once you have sphinx:

::

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

Contributing
============

All contributions are welcome: with a particular emphasis on
contributing further strategies.

You can find helpful instructions about contributing in the
documentation:
