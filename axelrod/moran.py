        An agent based Moran process class. In each round, each player plays a
        Match with each other player. Players are assigned a fitness score by
        their total score from all matches in the round. A player is chosen to
        reproduce proportionally to fitness, possibly mutated, and is cloned.
        The clone replaces a randomly chosen player.

        If the mutation_rate is 0, the population will eventually fixate on
        exactly one player type. In this case a StopIteration exception is
        raised and the play stops. If the mutation_rate is not zero, then the
        process will iterate indefinitely, so mp.play() will never exit, and
        you should use the class as an iterator instead.

        When a player mutates it chooses a random player type from the initial
        population. This is not the only method yet emulates the common method
        in the literature.

        It is possible to pass interaction graphs and reproduction graphs to the
        Moran process. In this case, in each round, each player plays a
        Match with each neighboring player according to the interaction graph.
        Players are assigned a fitness score by their total score from all
        matches in the round. A player is chosen to reproduce proportionally to
        fitness, possibly mutated, and is cloned. The clone replaces a randomly
        chosen neighboring player according to the reproduction graph.
