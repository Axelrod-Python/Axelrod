class Nydegger(Player):
    """
    Submitted to Axelrod's first tournament by Rudy Nydegger.

    The program begins with tit for tat for the first three moves, except
    that if it was the only one to cooperate on the first move and the only one
    to defect on the second move, it defects on the third move. After the
    third move, its choice is determined from the 3 preceding outcomes in the
    following manner.

    .. math::

        A = 16 a_1 + 4 a_2 + a_3

    Where :math:`a_i` is dependent on the outcome of the previous :math:`i` th
    round.  If both strategies defect, :math:`a_i=3`, if the opponent only defects:
    :math:`a_i=2` and finally if it is only this strategy that defects then
    :math:`a_i=1`.

    Finally this strategy defects if and only if:

    .. math::

        A \in \{1, 6, 7, 17, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 38, 39, 45, 49, 54, 55, 58, 61\}

    Thus if all three preceding moves are mutual defection, A = 63 and the rule
    cooperates. This rule was designed for use in laboratory experiments as a
    stooge which had a memory and appeared to be trustworthy, potentially
    cooperative, but not gullible.
