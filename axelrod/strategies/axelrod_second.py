class Tranquilizer(Player):

    """
    Submitted to Axelrod's second tournament by Craig Feathers

    Description given in Axelrod's "More Effective Choice in the
    Prisoner's Dilemma" paper: The rule normally cooperates but
    is ready to defect if the other player defects too often.
    Thus the rule tends to cooperate for the first dozen or two moves
    if the other player is cooperating, but then it throws in a
    defection. If the other player continues to cooperate, then defections
    become more frequent. But as long as Tranquilizer is maintaining an
    average payoff of at least 2.25 points per move, it will never defect
    twice in succession and it will not defect more than
    one-quarter of the time.

    This implementation is based on the reverse engineering of the
    Fortran strategy K67R from Axelrod's second tournament.
    Reversed engineered by: Owen Campbell, Will Guo and Mansour Hakem.

    The strategy starts by cooperating and has 3 states.

    At the start of the strategy it updates its states:

    - It counts the number of consecutive defections by the opponent.
    - If it was in state 2 it moves to state 0 and calculates the
      following quantities two_turns_after_good_defection_ratio and
      two_turns_after_good_defection_ratio_count.

      Formula for:

      two_turns_after_good_defection_ratio:

      self.two_turns_after_good_defection_ratio = (
      ((self.two_turns_after_good_defection_ratio
      * self.two_turns_after_good_defection_ratio_count)
      + (3 - (3 * self.dict[opponent.history[-1]]))
      + (2 * self.dict[self.history[-1]])
      - ((self.dict[opponent.history[-1]]
      * self.dict[self.history[-1]])))
      / (self.two_turns_after_good_defection_ratio_count + 1)
      )

      two_turns_after_good_defection_ratio_count =
      two_turns_after_good_defection_ratio + 1

    - If it was in state 1 it moves to state 2 and calculates the
      following quantities one_turn_after_good_defection_ratio and
      one_turn_after_good_defection_ratio_count.

      Formula for:

      one_turn_after_good_defection_ratio:

      self.one_turn_after_good_defection_ratio = (
      ((self.one_turn_after_good_defection_ratio
      * self.one_turn_after_good_defection_ratio_count)
      + (3 - (3 * self.dict[opponent.history[-1]]))
      + (2 * self.dict[self.history[-1]])
      - (self.dict[opponent.history[-1]]
      * self.dict[self.history[-1]]))
      / (self.one_turn_after_good_defection_ratio_count + 1)
      )

      one_turn_after_good_defection_ratio_count:

      one_turn_after_good_defection_ratio_count =
      one_turn_after_good_defection_ratio + 1

    If after this it is in state 1 or 2 then it cooperates.

    If it is in state 0 it will potentially perform 1 of the 2
    following stochastic tests:

    1. If average score per turn is greater than 2.25 then it calculates a
    value of probability:

    probability = (
    (.95 - (((self.one_turn_after_good_defection_ratio)
    + (self.two_turns_after_good_defection_ratio) - 5) / 15))
    + (1 / (((len(self.history))+1) ** 2))
    - (self.dict[opponent.history[-1]] / 4)
    )

    and will cooperate if a random sampled number is less than that value of
    probability. If it does not cooperate then the strategy moves to state 1
    and defects.

    2. If average score per turn is greater than 1.75 but less than 2.25
    then it calculates a value of probability:

    probability = (
    (.25 + ((opponent.cooperations + 1) / ((len(self.history)) + 1)))
    - (self.opponent_consecutive_defections * .25)
    + ((current_score[0]
    - current_score[1]) / 100)
    + (4 / ((len(self.history)) + 1))
    )

    and will cooperate if a random sampled number is less than that value of
    probability. If not, it defects.

    If none of the above holds the player simply plays tit for tat.

    Tranquilizer came in 27th place in Axelrod's second torunament.

class Borufsen(Player):
    """
    Strategy submitted to Axelrod's second tournament by Otto Borufsen
    (K32R), and came in third in that tournament.

    This player keeps track of the the opponent's responses to own behavior:

    - `cd_count` counts: Opponent cooperates as response to player defecting.
    - `cc_count` counts: Opponent cooperates as response to player cooperating.

    The player has a defect mode and a normal mode.  In defect mode, the
    player will always defect.  In normal mode, the player obeys the following
    ranked rules:

    1. If in the last three turns, both the player/opponent defected, then
       cooperate for a single turn.
    2. If in the last three turns, the player/opponent acted differently from
       each other and they're alternating, then change next defect to
       cooperate.  (Doesn't block third rule.)
    3. Otherwise, do tit-for-tat.

    Start in normal mode, but every 25 turns starting with the 27th turn,
    re-evaluate the mode.  Enter defect mode if any of the following
    conditions hold:

    - Detected random:  Opponent cooperated 7-18 times since last mode
      evaluation (or start) AND less than 70% of opponent cooperation was in
      response to player's cooperation, i.e.
      cc_count / (cc_count+cd_count) < 0.7
    - Detect defective:  Opponent cooperated fewer than 3 times since last mode
      evaluation.

    When switching to defect mode, defect immediately.  The first two rules for
    normal mode require that last three turns were in normal mode.  When starting
    normal mode from defect mode, defect on first move.

    """
    Strategy submitted to Axelrod's second tournament by Herb Weiner (K41R),
    and came in seventh in that tournament.

    Play Tit-for-Tat with a chance for forgiveness and a defective override.

    The chance for forgiveness happens only if `forgive_flag` is raised
    (flag discussed below).  If raised and `turn` is greater than `grudge`,
    then override Tit-for-Tat with Cooperation.  `grudge` is a variable that
    starts at 0 and increments 20 with each forgiven Defect (a Defect that is
    overriden through the forgiveness logic).  `forgive_flag` is lower whether
    logic is overriden or not.

    The variable `defect_padding` increments with each opponent Defect, but
    resets to zero with each opponent Cooperate (or `forgive_flag` lowering) so
    that it roughly counts Defects between Cooperates.  Whenever the opponent
    Cooperates, if `defect_padding` (before reseting) is odd, then we raise
    `forgive_flag` for next turn.

    Finally a defective override is assessed after forgiveness.  If five or
    more of the opponent's last twelve actions are Defects, then Defect.  This
    will overrule a forgiveness, but doesn't undo the lowering of
    `forgiveness_flag`.  Note that "last twelve actions" doesn't count the most
    recent action.  Actually the original code updates history after checking
    for defect override.

class Harrington(Player):
    """
    Strategy submitted to Axelrod's second tournament by Paul Harrington (K75R)
    and came in eighth in that tournament.

    This strategy has three modes:  Normal, Fair-weather, and Defect.  These
    mode names were not present in Harrington's submission.

    In Normal and Fair-weather modes, the strategy begins by:

    - Update history
    - Try to detect random opponent if turn is multiple of 15 and >=30.
    - Check if `burned` flag should be raised.
    - Check for Fair-weather opponent if turn is 38.

    Updating history means to increment the correct cell of the `move_history`.
    `move_history` is a matrix where the columns are the opponent's previous
    move and the rows are indexed by the combo of this player's and the
    opponent's moves two turns ago.  [The upper-left cell must be all
    Cooperations, but otherwise order doesn't matter.]  After we enter Defect
    mode, `move_history` won't be used again.

    If the turn is a multiple of 15 and >=30, then attempt to detect random.
    If random is detected, enter Defect mode and defect immediately.  If the
    player was previously in Defect mode, then do not re-enter.  The random
    detection logic is a modified Pearson's Chi Squared test, with some
    additional checks.  [More details in `detect_random` docstrings.]

    Some of this player's moves are marked as "generous."  If this player made
    a generous move two turns ago and the opponent replied with a Defect, then
    raise the `burned` flag.  This will stop certain generous moves later.

    The player mostly plays Tit-for-Tat for the first 36 moves, then defects on
    the 37th move.  If the opponent cooperates on the first 36 moves, and
    defects on the 37th move also, then enter Fair-weather mode and cooperate
    this turn.  Entering Fair-weather mode is extremely rare, since this can
    only happen if the opponent cooperates for the first 36 then defects
    unprovoked on the 37th.  (That is, this player's first 36 moves are also
    Cooperations, so there's nothing really to trigger an opponent Defection.)

    Next in Normal Mode:

    1. Check for defect and parity streaks.
    2. Check if cooperations are scheduled.
    3. Otherwise,

    - If turn < 37, Tit-for-Tat.
    - If turn = 37, defect, mark this move as generous, and schedule two
      more cooperations**.
    - If turn > 37, then if `burned` flag is raised, then Tit-for-Tat.
      Otherwise, Tit-for-Tat with probability 1 - `prob`.  And with
      probability `prob`, defect, schedule two cooperations, mark this move
      as generous, and increase `prob` by 5%.

    ** Scheduling two cooperations means to set `more_coop` flag to two.  If in
    Normal mode and no streaks are detected, then the player will cooperate and
    lower this flag, until hitting zero.  It's possible that the flag can be
    overwritten.  Notable on the 37th turn defect, this is set to two, but the
    38th turn Fair-weather check will set this.

    If the opponent's last twenty moves were defections, then defect this turn.
    Then check for a parity streak, by flipping the parity bit (there are two
    streaks that get tracked which are something like odd and even turns, but
    this flip bit logic doesn't get run every turn), then incrementing the
    parity streak that we're pointing to.  If the parity streak that we're
    pointing to is then greater than `parity_limit` then reset the streak and
    cooperate immediately.  `parity_limit` is initially set to five, but after
    it has been hit eight times, it decreases to three.  The parity streak that
    we're pointing to also gets incremented if in normal mode and we defect but
    not on turn 38, unless we are defecting as the result of a defect streak.
    Note that the parity streaks resets but the defect streak doesn't.

    If `more_coop` >= 1, then we cooperate and lower that flag here, in Normal
    mode after checking streaks.  Still lower this flag if cooperating as the
    result of a parity streak or in Fair-weather mode.

    Then use the logic based on turn from above.

    In Fair-Weather mode after running the code from above, check if opponent
    defected last turn.  If so, exit Fair-Weather mode, and proceed THIS TURN
    with Normal mode.  Otherwise cooperate.

    In Defect mode, update the `exit_defect_meter` (originally zero) by
    incrementing if opponent defected last turn and decreasing by three
    otherwise.  If `exit_defect_meter` is then 11, then set mode to Normal (for
    future turns), cooperate and schedule two more cooperations.  [Note that
    this move is not marked generous.]

class RichardHufford(Player):
    """
    Strategy submitted to Axelrod's second tournament by Richard Hufford (K47R)
    and came in sixteenth in that tournament.

    The strategy tracks opponent "agreements", that is whenever the opponent's
    previous move is the some as this player's move two turns ago.  If the
    opponent's first move is a Defection, this is counted as a disagreement,
    and otherwise an agreement.  From the agreement counts, two measures are
    calculated:

    - `proportion_agree`:  This is the number of agreements (through opponent's
      last turn) + 2 divided by the current turn number.
    - `last_four_num`:  The number of agreements in the last four turns.  If
      there have been fewer than four previous turns, then this is number of
      agreement + (4 - number of past turns).

    We then use these measures to decide how to play, using these rules:

    1. If `proportion_agree` > 0.9 and `last_four_num` >= 4, then Cooperate.
    2. Otherwise if `proportion_agree` >= 0.625 and `last_four_num` >= 2, then
       Tit-for-Tat.
    3. Otherwise, Defect.

    However, if the opponent has Cooperated the last `streak_needed` turns,
    then the strategy deviates from the usual strategy, and instead Defects.
    (We call such deviation an "aberration".)  In the turn immediately after an
    aberration, the strategy doesn't override, even if there's a streak of
    Cooperations.  Two turns after an aberration, the strategy:  Restarts the
    Cooperation streak (never looking before this turn); Cooperates; and
    changes `streak_needed` to:

    floor(20.0 * `num_abb_def` / `num_abb_coop`) + 1

    Here `num_abb_def` is 2 + the number of times that the opponent Defected in
    the turn after an aberration, and `num_abb_coop` is 2 + the number of times
    that the opponent Cooperated in response to an aberration.
