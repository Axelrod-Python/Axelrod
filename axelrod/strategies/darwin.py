    A strategy which accumulates a record (the 'genome') of what the most
    favourable response in the previous round should have been, and naively
    assumes that this will remain the correct response at the same round of
    future trials.

    This 'genome' is preserved between opponents, rounds and repetitions of
    the tournament.  It becomes a characteristic of the type and so a single
    version of this is shared by all instances for each loading of the class.

    As this results in information being preserved between tournaments, this
    is classified as a cheating strategy!

    If no record yet exists, the opponent's response from the previous round
    is returned.
