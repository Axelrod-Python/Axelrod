class LookerUp(Player):
    """
    A strategy that uses a lookup table to decide what to do based on a
    combination of the last m1 plays, m2 opponent plays, and the opponent's
    opening n actions. If there isn't enough history to do this (i.e. for the
    first m1 or m2 turns) then cooperate.

    The lookup table is implemented as a dict. The keys are 3-tuples giving the
    opponents first n actions, self's last m1 actions, and opponents last m2
    actions, all as strings. The values are the actions to play on this round.

    For example, in the case of m1=m2=n=1, if
    - the opponent started by playing C
    - my last action was a C the opponents
    - last action was a D
    then the corresponding key would be

        ('C', 'C', 'D')

    and the value would contain the action to play on this turn.

    Some well-known strategies can be expressed as special cases; for example
    Cooperator is given by the dict::

        {('', '', '') : C}

    where m and n are both zero. Tit-For-Tat is given by::

       {('', 'C', 'D'): D,
        ('', 'D', 'D'): D,
        ('', 'C', 'C'): C,
        ('', 'D', 'C'): C}

    where m=1 and n=0.

    Lookup tables where the action depends on the opponent's first actions (as
    opposed to most recent actions) will have a non-empty first string in the
    tuple. For example, this fragment of a dict::

       {('C', 'C', 'C'): C,
        ('D', 'C', 'C'): D}

    states that if self and opponent both cooperated on the previous turn, we
    should cooperate this turn unless the opponent started by defecting, in
    which case we should defect.

    To denote lookup tables where the action depends on sequences of actions
    (so m or n are greater than 1), simply concatenate the strings together.

    Below is an incomplete example where m1=m2=3 and n=2.
