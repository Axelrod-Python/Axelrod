Part of the team
----------------

If you’re reading this you’re probably interested in contributing to and/or
using the Axelrod library! Firstly: **thank you**!

We are not only proud of the library but also of the environment
that surrounds it. Everyone is expected to act in an open and welcoming,
considerate and respectful way.

The Axelrod library has been a first contribution to open source software for
many, and this is in large part due to the fact that we all aim to help and
encourage all levels of contribution. If you're a beginner, that's awesome!
You're very welcome and don't hesitate to ask for help.

**With regards to any contribution**, please do not feel the need to wait until
your contribution is perfectly polished and complete: we're happy to offer
early feedback.

**If you are using the library for your own work** and there's anything in the
documentation that is unclear: we want to know so that we can fix it. We also
want to help so please don't hesitate to get in touch.
