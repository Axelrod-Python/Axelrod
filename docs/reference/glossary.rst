Glossary
========

There are a variety of terms used in the documentation and throughout the
library. Here is an overview:

An action
---------

An **action** is either :code:`C` or :code:`D`.
You can access these actions as follows but should not really have a reason to::

    >>> import axelrod as axl
    >>> axl.Actions.C
    'C'
    >>> axl.Actions.D
    'D'

A play
------

A **play** is a single player choosing an **action**.
In terms of code this is equivalent to::

    >>> p1, p2 = axl.Cooperator(), axl.Defector()
    >>> p1.play(p2)  # This constitues two 'plays' (p1 plays and p2 plays).

This is equivalent to :code:`p2.play(p1)`. Either function invokes both
:code:`p1.strategy(p2)` and :code:`p2.strategy(p1)`.

A turn
------

A **turn** is a 1 shot interaction between two players. It is in effect a
composition of two **plays**.

Each turn has four possible outcomes of a play: :code:`(C, C)`, :code:`(C, D)`,
:code:`(D, C)`, or :code:`(D, D)`.

A match
-------

A **match** is a consecutive number of **turns**. The default number of turns
used in the tournament is 200. Here is a single match between two players over
10 turns::

    >>> p1, p2 = axl.Cooperator(), axl.Defector()
    >>> for turn in range(10):
    ...     p1.play(p2)
    >>> p1.history, p2.history
    (['C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C'], ['D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D'])

A round robin
-------------

A **round robin** is the set of all potential (order invariant) matches between
a given collection of players.

A tournament
------------

A **tournament** is a repetition of round robins so as to smooth out stochastic effects.
