Guidelines
==========

All contributions to this repository are welcome via pull request on the `github repository <https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod>`_.

The project follows the following guidelines:

1. Use the base Python library unless completely necessary. A few external
   libraries (such as numpy) have been included in requirements.txt -- feel free
   to use these as needed.
2. Try as best as possible to follow `PEP8
   <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ which includes **using
   descriptive variable names**.
3. Testing: the project uses the `unittest
   <https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html>`_ library and has a nice
   testing suite that makes some things very easy to write tests for. Please try
   to increase the test coverage on pull requests.
4. Merging pull-requests: We require two of the (currently four) core-team
   maintainers to merge. Opening a PR for early
   feedback or to check test coverage is OK, just indicate that the PR is not ready
   to merge (and update when it is).

By submitting a pull request, you are agreeing that your work may be distributed
under the terms of the project's `licence <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/master/LICENSE.txt>`_ and you will become one of the project's joint copyright holders.
