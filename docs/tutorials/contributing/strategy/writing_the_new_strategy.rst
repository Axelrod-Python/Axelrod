Writing the new strategy
========================

Identify a new strategy
-----------------------

The library has a large number of strategies::

    >>> import axelrod as axl
    >>> len(axl.strategies)
    103

If you're not sure if you have a strategy that has already been implemented
please get in touch: `via the gitter room
<https://gitter.im/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod>`_ or `open an issue
<https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/issues>`_.

Several strategies are special cases of other strategies. For example, both
`Cooperator` and `Defector` are special cases of `Random`, `Random(1)` and
`Random(0)` respectively. While we could eliminate `Cooperator` in its current
form, these strategies are intentionally left as is as simple examples for new
users and contributors. Nevertheless, please feel free to update the docstrings
of strategies like `Random` to point out such cases.

The code
--------

There are a couple of things that need to be created in a strategy.py file.  Let
us take a look at the :code:`TitForTat` class (located in the
:code:`axelrod/strategies/titfortat.py` file)::

    class TitForTat(Player):
        """
        A player starts by cooperating and then mimics previous move by
        opponent.

        Note that the code for this strategy is written in a fairly verbose
        way. This is done so that it can serve as an example strategy for
        those who might be new to Python.
        """

        # These are various properties for the strategy
        name = 'Tit For Tat'
        classifier = {
            'memory_depth': 1,  # Four-Vector = (1.,0.,1.,0.)
            'stochastic': False,
            'inspects_source': False,
            'manipulates_source': False,
            'manipulates_state': False
        }

        def strategy(self, opponent):
            """This is the actual strategy"""
            # First move
            if len(self.history) == 0:
                return C
            # React to the opponent's last move
            if opponent.history[-1] == D:
                return D
            return C

The first thing that is needed is a docstring that explains what the strategy
does::

    """A player starts by cooperating and then mimics previous move by opponent."""

After that simply add in the string that will appear as the name of the
strategy::

    name = 'Tit For Tat'

Note that this is mainly used in plots by :code:`matplotlib` so you can use
LaTeX if you want to.  For example there is strategy with :math:`\pi` as a
name::

    name = '$\pi$'

Following that you can add in the :code:`classifier` dictionary::

        classifier = {
            'memory_depth': 1,  # Four-Vector = (1.,0.,1.,0.)
            'stochastic': False,
            'inspects_source': False,
            'manipulates_source': False,
            'manipulates_state': False
        }

This helps classify the strategy as described in
:ref:`classification-of-strategies`.

After that the only thing required is to write the :code:`strategy` method
which takes an opponent as an argument. In the case of :code:`TitForTat` the
strategy checks if it has any history (:code:`if len(self.history) == 0`). If
it does not (ie this is the first play of the match) then it returns :code:`C`.
If not, the strategy simply repeats the opponent's last move (:code:`return
opponent.history[-1]`)::

    def strategy(opponent):
        """This is the actual strategy"""
        # First move
        if len(self.history) == 0:
            return C
        # Repeat the opponent's last move
        return opponent.history[-1]

The variables :code:`C` and :code:`D` represent the cooperate and defect actions respectively.

If your strategy creates any particular attribute along the way you need to make
sure that there is a :code:`reset` method that takes account of it.  An example
of this is the :code:`ForgetfulGrudger` strategy.

You can also modify the name of the strategy with the `__repr__` method, which
is invoked when `str` is applied to a player instance. For example, the player
`Random` takes a parameter `p` for how often it cooperates, and the `__repr__`
method adds the value of this parameter to the name::

    def __repr__(self):
        return "%s: %s" % (self.name, round(self.p, 2))

Now we have separate names for different instantiations::

    >>> import axelrod
    >>> player1 = axelrod.Random(p=0.5)
    >>> player2 = axelrod.Random(p=0.1)
    >>> player1
    Random: 0.5
    >>> player2
    Random: 0.1

This helps distinguish players in tournaments that have multiple instances of the
same strategy. If you modify the `__repr__` method of player, be sure to add an
appropriate test.

There are various examples of helpful functions and properties that make
writing strategies easier. Do not hesitate to get in touch with the
Axelrod-Python team for guidance.
