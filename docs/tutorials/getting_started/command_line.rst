Using the command line tool
===========================

Once :code:`axelrod` is installed you have access to a `run_axelrod` script that
can help run some of the tournaments, including the tournament that involves all
of the strategies from the library. You can view them at `Axelrod-Python/tournament on GitHub <https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/tournament/>`_

To view the help for the :code:`run_axelrod` file run::

    $ run_axelrod -h

Note that if you have not installed the package you can still use this script
directly from the repository::

    $ run_axelrod -h

There is a variety of options that include:

- Excluding certain strategy sets.
- Not running the ecological variant.
- Running the rounds of the tournament in parallel.
- Include background noise

Particular parameters can also be changed:

- The output directory for the plot and csv files.
- The number of turns and repetitions for the tournament.
- The format of created images

Here is a command that will run the whole tournament, excluding the strategies
that do not obey Axelrod's original rules and using all available CPUS (this can
take quite a while!)::

    $ run_axelrod --xc -p 0
